A lot of the information around building PC's now is geared toward gaming rigs. I haven't used a computer for gaming since I went through a SIMS phase after college. So my choices were geared toward building something that would be good for coding, streaming, and general use. 
		
Let's start with the case. I did not want a black box early 2000's Dell-looking thing sitting on or under my desk. So I chose a case that had the flexibility of fitting several motherboard form factors, space for cable management, and a nice clean look. Which is how I landed on the [Fractal Meshify-C White ](https://www.newegg.com/fractal-design-meshify-c-white-tg-atx-mid-tower/p/N82E16811352087?Description=fractal%20meshify-c%20white&cm_re=fractal_meshify-c%20white-_-11-352-087-_-Product&quicklink=true)case, which has lots of air flow and a tempered glass side, which was unnecessary, but the solid-sided version cost more at the time.
		
My next choice was the CPU. I chose an Intel i5 10600. It has 6 cores, 12 threads, supports dual-channel DDR4 memory and had a higher operating frequency than the i7 10700 I had initially picked out. It also has integrated graphics. It's more than enough for what I want to do, and it came with a heatsink and fan. 
		
With the CPU chosen, it was time to pick a compatible motherboard. I'll be honest here-- I didn't put a lot of thought into the motherboard or what chipset it uses. I wanted to have Intel compatibility, wifi, and bluetooth. I landed on the [GIGABYTE B460 Aorus Pro AC](https://www.newegg.com/p/N82E16813145211?Description=gigabyte%20b460%20aorus%20pro%20ac&cm_re=gigabyte_b460%20aorus%20pro%20ac-_-13-145-211-_-Product&quicklink=true) motherboard, which had all the right connectors and capabilities for my project. The RGB light controls were a bonus. The onboard video/audio capabilities are also a bonus. 
		
Next came the RAM. I chose 16gb of DDR4 RAM because that seemed like plenty, although my motherboard can support up to 124gb of RAM, which just sounds wild to me. I used 2 8gb Corsair Vengeance LPX memory sticks. I have used Corsair memory sticks to expand RAM in laptops, and it always performs well for me. 
		
For storage, I chose a Western Digital NVMe M.2 SSD with 500gb of space. It is installed under a heatsink directly on the motherboard, so no cables involved. It's also supposed to be a lot faster than a traditional SSD. 
Finally, for the power supply. I chose a Corsair 550V non-modular power supply. I wasn't picky about the power supply-- I just wanted something that would more than cover the needed power based on my components with capacity for any added upgrades later.

The absolute last thing I chose, and this was completely unneccessary, was a set of 3 multi-color RGB fans with white cases. This was an aesthetic choice, and it makes me happy. 

You might be wondering why I skipped the graphics card. I had a couple of reasons. The first was that I wanted to keep my budget under $800. Graphics cards can run several hundred dollars, and good ones are hard to come by right now. Mostly due to demand from hobbyists who are building their own computers, or because of manufacturing shortages and tariffs, but also because they're used for mining rigs for cryptocurrency. The second reason was that I didn't really need it. I'm not going to be doing a lot of gaming, photo editing, or video rendering. The integrated graphics in my CPU and the video capabilities of the chipset on my motherboard are enough for my use. 

 The end result of my project is a nice desktop computer that does exactly what I need it to with some room for growth, for way less than I could find a laptop with similar specs.
