Last week, while my husband and I were discussing what to do with some Christmas money we received, we fell on the idea of building a computer to use for projects, and to free up a laptop for our kids to use for schoolwork on the days they do virtual learning. Right now, one of them uses a school-issued Chromebook, and it's so locked down we can't even block him from pulling up youtube while he's supposed to be on zoom. *ahem*

Anyway, since I am going through the self-paced bootcamp program, I thought it would be useful to also understand how hardware works, and to go through the process of selecting, assembling, and running my own computer. I realize this is information that my husband learned while he was getting his CS degree, and at that time, we actually built a desktop PC that I used in college. I had no idea what we were doing, but I diligently handed him screws and nodded along as he installed Windows XP for me. 

Since then, my experience with hardware components has been limited to adding RAM to laptop expansion slots, or upgrading the HDD to a SSD in my 6 year old ASUS. I have also helped tear apart and reassemble the keyboard on my husbands ROG laptop when a few of the keys stopped working, but he did all the research. I just helped with soldering because that project required at least 4 hands. 

This project will be mine. I am doing the research to learn about the parts, watching videos on how to assemble them, and learning how to get an OS onto a brand new machine. My other half will just be here for guidance and to answer questions. 

So I spent the weekend scouring Newegg, looking at cases, learning about motherboard form factors, finding out the difference between an Intel Core i5-10600 and an Intel Core i7-10700, and trying to decide whether an M.2 or standard SSD was the best form of storage.

The final result will be a mid-tower ATX case containing an intel Core i5-10600 10th gen CPU with integrated graphics (because I am not editing huge videos or doing a bunch of image processing), a Gigabyte B460 Aorus Pro ATX motherboard with dual M.2 slots, wifi, and bluetooth built in, 16GB of RAM (DDR4), 500GB M.2 SSD, and a Corsair 550W non-modular power supply. The total cost was about $750, plus shipping and taxes, which is about half of what you would pay for a laptop with those specs. The motherboard I chose allows for lots of expansion, and the CPU has 4 more cores and a much faster operating frequency that my current laptop.

My current plan is to run Linux on this new machine. I might add a second SSD later and run windows 10 from it. But this set up with the spare bays in the case will allow for lots of flexibility based on what projects we decide to use it for. 

Step 2: Hover by the front door while waiting for all my packages to arrive.
