Thanks to Newegg overestimating their delivery times, I now have all the parts I ordered. This weekend, I spent some time reading manuals, looking up how to tell which pin is the positive pin on multi-pin connectors, and being very diligent about static discharge. I live in Pennsylvania, and we've had a blanket of snow here for the past couple of weeks. The air is very dry. 

The first pieces I received were the Intel Core i5 10600 CPU with stock fan and heatsink, 16gb of ram on 2 Corsair Vengeance LPX sticks, the Fractal Meshify-C white case, and a Western Digital 500gb NVMe M.2 hard drive. Between receiving those parts and the mother board, I watched a couple of hours worth of computer assembly videos on YouTube so that I was confident I knew what went where, how it fit, and what it does. 

When the motherboard arrived, I rolled out a rubber mat, unwrapped everything and got to work. The CPU was easily installed with a built in bracket on the motherboard. The force required to get it into place made me nervous, but it fit correctly and nothing broke (hooray!). I then installed the heatsink and fan, which came with thermal paste already applied. I might upgrade to a nicer CPU cooler later on, but this is fine for now. Once the CPU was squared away, I moved on to the RAM. My motherboard has dual channel RAM, so I had to double check with the manual to make sure my 2 sticks of ram were inserted in the same channel. The last thing I installed on the motherboard was the M.2 SSD, which installed under its own heatsink, out of sight.

The final part I need to get up and running is the power supply, which arrived yesterday. It's a Corsair 550v non-modular power supply, which is more than enough for this build. Rule of thumb is to take the average volts your system needs and multiply it by two to get the right voltage power supply, and the average voltage for my system is 130v. 
The only wires I needed from my power supply at this point is the 24-pin motherboard connector and the 8-pin CPU connector. There are available cords for both HDD and SSD, as well as optical drives if I choose to add them in the future. Right now, those cords are just neatly tucked away between the power supply and the drive rack in the back of the case.

With all of the front panel connectors, USB connectors, fan connectors, and power connecters installed on the motherboard, it was time to tackle cord management. The case I chose has a back panel to hide all the cords, but you have to tie them down so you can get the back panel back on without slicing anything. There are lots of grommets for tying things down, and there are actually included velcro strips for tying down the majority of the front panel cords, fan cords, and the main power to the motherboard. This case made it easy to make everything tidy.

Finally, it was time to re-assemble the case and power everyhing on. My diligent research paid off, because power-up worked on the first try! Now to get an OS installed and configured. But that's a post for another day. Stay tuned for part 3!
